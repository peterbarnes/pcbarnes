      The Gameroom is a local business in Lincoln, NE that specializes in all kinds of media.  They sell everything from games to movies to electronics and they needed a website!  This website allows users to get information on store locations, send emails to the store, see what specials are going on, and much more!

        WEB APPS
    %p.long-text
      Web apps are so widely used now that it is basically essential to develop web apps as a programmer.  &nbsp;When writing web apps I work primarily in the 
      %a.long-text{ href: "http://rubyonrails.org", target: "blank" }
        Ruby on Rails
      framework which requires a strong knowledge of
      %a.long-text{ href: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML", target: "blank" }
        HTML
      ,
      %a.long-text{ href: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets", target: "blank"}
        CSS
      ,
      %a.long-text{ href: "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript", target: "blank" }
        Javascript
      , and 
      %a.long-text{ href: "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/", target: "blank" }
        Ruby
      
    %p.long-text
      Form projects that don't require the amount of power that rails gives you, I prefer
      %a.long-text{ href: "http://www.sinatrarb.com/", target: "blank" }
        Sinatra
      as a light-weight framework that still gives you many of the advantages that come with using Ruby as a web-development language.
    %p.long-text
      FYI, the site you are viewing right now was built with Ruby on Rails!

        WHAT I USE
    %p.long-text
      I use
      %a.long-text{ href: "https://www.apple.com/osx/", target: "blank" }
        OS X
      as my operating system and 
      %a.long-text{ href: "http://www.sublimetext.com/2", target: "blank" }
        Sublime Text 2
      as my text editor.
    %p.long-text
      For testing Rails and Sinatra apps in development, I use
      %a.long-text{ href: "http://pow.cx/", target: "blank" }
        Pow
      
    %p.long-text
      When a web app is ready for production, I use
      %a.long-text{ href: "https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps", target: "blank" }
        Heroku

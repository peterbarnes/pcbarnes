    <h4 class="long-text">Down In Circles is the name of the band that I play guitar in.  We've been together for years and just recently realized that we needed a website that we could use to promote ourselves and give our fans another way to hear our music and keep up with us.  This website is a basic site that allows users to read about us, see upcoming shows, and listen to our music.</h4>

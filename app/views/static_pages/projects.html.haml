      The Gameroom is a local business in Lincoln, NE that specializes in all kinds of media.  They sell everything from games to movies to electronics and they needed a website!  This website allows users to get information on store locations, send emails to the store, see what specials are going on, and much more!

      Down In Circles is the name of the band that I play guitar in.  We've been together for years and just recently realized that we needed a website that we could use to promote ourselves and give our fans another way to hear our music and keep up with us.  This website is a basic site that allows users to read about us, see upcoming shows, and listen to our music.

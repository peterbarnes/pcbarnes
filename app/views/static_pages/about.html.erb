      My name is Peter Barnes and my goal is to create functional, innovative, and attractive applications. &nbsp;I mention this quite often around the site because it is a reoccuring theme. &nbsp;I've been writing software since July of 2013 and something that I always focus on when making an application is design, because the user interface is what will sell your app. &nbsp;I also design my apps to be simple to use and I often ask myself, "If I had to use this app, how would I want it to work?" which has not only led to a simpler user interface, but also a much simpler code base. &nbsp;I started with writing simple HTML webpages and eventually learned CSS and Javascript after that which is where I got my basic understanding of web design. &nbsp;I started working with rails around January of 2014 and immediately began to create complex applications (You can view a list of some of my projects <%= link_to "here", projects_path, class: "long-text" %>) and started working at Infinite Token, where I am currently employed.
